## What I do?
<!-- - Ship backend features that works the way users expect, with clear interfaces and predictable behavior.
- Explain trade-offs in simple terms so stakeholders can choose confidently.
- Prevent "mistry-outages" by fixing root causes and building guardrails.
- Keep costs sensible by designing for scale without over-engineering. -->
