## II. Questions & Answers

- What is _association_, _aggregation_, and _composition_ and how do they differ from each other?
- What real-world problems do they solve? Use an example to explain how they solve the problem?

### 2. Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation
- What are the four main pillars of OOP: _abstraction_, _inheritance_, _polymorphism_, and _encapsulation_?
- What is _abstraction_? Explain the underlying problem it solves. Use an example to explain **how**.
- What is _inheritance_? Explain the underlying problem it solves. Use an example to explain **how**.
- What is _encapsulation_? Explain the underlying problem it solves. Use an example to explain **how**.
- What is _polymorphism_? Explain the underlying problem it solves. Use an example to explain **how**.
- Explain using an example how _abstraction_ and _encapsulation_ differ from each other?
- What problems arise in systems that heavily rely on _inheritance_ and how we can solve these problems?
